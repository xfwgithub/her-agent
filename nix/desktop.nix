# nix/desktop.nix — her Desktop (Electron) app build + wrapper

# `herAgent` is the fully-built `.#default` package — it ships the
# `her` binary with the venv, runtime PATH, bundled skills/plugins, etc.
# already wired up.  We point the desktop at it via the existing
# `HER_DESKTOP` override env var, so the desktop's resolver
# uses our fully wrapped binary at step 4 ("existing her CLI").
# No reimplementation of the agent resolution in this wrapper.
