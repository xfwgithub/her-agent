"""Regression tests for the docker-exec privilege-drop shim.

The shim (docker/her-exec-shim.sh, installed at /opt/her/bin/her)
exists to prevent the auth.json ownership-mismatch bug where
`docker exec <c> her login` would write /opt/data/auth.json as
root:root mode 0600, leaving the supervised gateway (UID 10000) unable
to read its own credentials and returning "Provider authentication
failed: her is not logged into Nous Portal" on every message.

These tests verify:

1. ``docker exec <c> her …`` (defaulting to root) gets dropped to the
   her user before the real binary runs.
2. ``docker exec --user her <c> her …`` (already non-root) short-
   circuits and doesn't try to drop again.
3. Files written under $HER_HOME from a ``docker exec`` session land
   as her:her — the actual user-visible invariant.
4. The HER_DOCKER_EXEC_AS_ROOT opt-out lets diagnostic sessions keep
   running as root deliberately.
5. The main CMD path (``docker run <image> …``) is unaffected by the
   PATH-shim ordering — no recursion, no behavior change.
